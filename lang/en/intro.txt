====== Referrers for DokuWiki ======

===== About =====

This plugin logs [[wp>HTTP_referer|HTTP Referrers]] for your site, so you can see where your traffic comes from.

Set the options for this plugin via the **Configuration Settings** menu from the DokuWiki admin menu. (It will be near the bottom of the page.)

===== Setup =====

The log will be located at the page [[:wiki:referrers|:wiki:referrers]], so you will need to create that page for this plugin to work.

It is also recommended that you use DokuWiki's **Access Control List Management** feature (available from the **Admin** page) to make '':wiki:referrers'' not publicly readable so search engines won't index it.

===== Support =====

For further support or discussion, please see the official plugin page [[doku>plugin:referrers|here]].

If you find this plugin useful, please consider supporting the project via [[http://tjgrant.com/wiki/donate|Donations]] or [[https://github.com/sponsors/tatewake|Sponsorships]]; thank you!
