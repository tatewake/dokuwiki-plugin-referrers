## About

This plugin logs [HTTP Referrers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) for your site, so you can see where your traffic comes from.

Set the options for this plugin via the **Configuration Settings** menu from the DokuWiki admin menu. (It will be near the bottom of the page.)

## Install / Upgrade

Search and install the plugin using the [Extension Manager](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:extension). Refer to [Plugins](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) on how to install plugins manually.

## Setup

The log will be located at the page `:wiki:referrers`, so you will need to create that page for this plugin to work.

It is also recommended that you use DokuWiki's **Access Control List Management** feature (available from the **Admin** page) to make `:wiki:referrers` not publicly readable so search engines won't index it.


All further documentation for this plugin can be found at:

## Contributing

The official repository for this plugin is available on GitHub:

The plugin thrives from community contributions. If you're able to provide useful code changes or bug fixes, they will likely be accepted to future versions of the plugin.

If you find my work helpful and would like to give back, [consider joining me as a GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/tatewake).

Thanks!
